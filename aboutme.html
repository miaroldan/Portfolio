    Hi! I'm Mia Roldan, a rising senior at Cresskill High School.  I was born in Petah Tikva, Israel and my middle name is Meytal. <br>
   I enjoy playing the piano, drawing, painting, cooking, playing volleyball, and coding ;).<p>
  
  <h2>My first coding project - A Side Scroller Game!<h2>

    Today, I learned the basics of Python. After using Scratch and Python aside from having very similar functions, they differ <br>
    in the way that in Scratch, the code is made up of pre-made drag-and-drop blocks, while in Python, the code is created by manually <br>
    typing them out. Throughout the majority of my first program, I was debugging it. Through frustrating and continuous trial and error, <br>
    I finally was able to make my code work, which was one of the most rewarding feelings I've felt.
